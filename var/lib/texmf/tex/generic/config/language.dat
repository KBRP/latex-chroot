% 00tex.cnf: header of the configuration file for language.dat

% configuration files in /etc/texmf/language.d/.  This file, 00tex.cnf, 
% contains only some comments on how to edit these files.

%%  To make it possible for package scripts to parse this file, 
%%  please use only "%! " to comment out hyphenation patterns!
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CAUTION: the first language will be the default if no style-file
%          (e.g. german.sty) is used.
% Since version 3.0 of TeX, hyphenation patterns for multiple languages are
% possible. Unless you know what you are doing, please let the american
% english patterns be the first ones. The babel system allows you to
% easily change the active language for your texts. For more information,
% have a look to the documentation in texmf/doc/generic/babel.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The hyphenation pattern files are in the directory:

% 
% language.us (and the start of language.dat)
% - initial hyphenation patterns.
% Created long ago by Sebastian Rahtz and others.  Public domain.
% 
% language.us is concatenated with the other language.*.dat files
% desired by the user to create language.dat.  This is done at the end
% of install-tl.sh.
% 
% The premade texmf/tex/generic/config/language.dat (where you might be
% reading this) in the distribution is a copy of this concatenation with
% all languages enabled.  It is used when the user asks to run live
% (install option R).
%
% The preferred comment for actual language lines is %!. Do not use %!
% for textual comments like this. This is to be able to separate
% textual comments from commented-out language in such a way that
% automatic parsing by programs is possible, so that 
% we can present the user with `all possible languages'.
% 
% *PLEASE*, keep english as the default (first) here, and let it refer
% to hyphen.tex (not, e.g., ushyph.tex), and do not change the
% hyphen.tex file, or name some other file hyphen.tex.  hyphen.tex must
% remain the original file from Knuth, and it must be \language0.
% Otherwise DEK will not be happy when he retypesets the Art of Computer
% Programming and gets new hyphenation.
% 
% The babel system allows you to easily change the active language for
% LaTeX. For more information, see the documentation in
% texmf-dist/doc/generic/babel/.  ConTeXt has its own language support too.
