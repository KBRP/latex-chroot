# dvipsPreferOutline
#
# Should dvips (by default) prefer bitmap fonts or outline fonts
# if both are available? Independend of this setting, outlines
# can be forced by putting "p psfonts_t1.map" into a config file
# that dvips reads. Bitmaps (for the fonts in question) can
# be forced by putting "p psfonts_pk.map" into a config file.
# We provide such config files which can be enabled via
# dvips -Poutline ... resp. dvips -Ppk ...
#
# Valid settings for dvipsPreferOutline are true / false:
dvipsPreferOutline true

#
# LW35
#
# Which fonts for the "Basic 35 Laserwriter Fonts" do you want to use and
# how are the filenames chosen? Valid settings:
#   URW:     URW fonts with "vendor" filenames (e.g. n019064l.pfb)
#   URWkb:   URW fonts with "berry" filenames (e.g. uhvbo8ac.pfb)
#   ADOBE:   Adobe fonts with "vendor" filenames (e.g. hvnbo___.pfb)
#   ADOBEkb: Adobe fonts with  "berry" filenames (e.g. phvbo8an.pfb)
LW35 URWkb

#
# dvipsDownloadBase35
# 
# Should dvips (by default) download the standard 35 LaserWriter fonts
# with the document (then set dvipsDownloadBase35 true) or should these
# fonts be used from the ps interpreter / printer?
# Whatever the default is, the user can override it by specifying
# dvips -Pdownload35 ... resp. dvips -Pbuiltin35 ... to either download
# the LW35 fonts resp. use the build-in fonts.
#
# Valid settings are true / false:
dvipsDownloadBase35 false

#
# pdftexDownloadBase14
#
# Should pdftex download the base 14 pdf fonts? Since some configurations
# (ps / pdf tools / printers) use bad default fonts, it is safer to download
# the fonts. The pdf files will get bigger, though.
# Valid settings are true (download the fonts) or false (don't download
# the fonts). Adobe recommends to embed all fonts.
pdftexDownloadBase14 true

#
# dvipdfmDownloadBase14
#
# Should dvipdfm download the base 14 pdf fonts? Since some configurations
# (ps / pdf tools / printers) use bad default fonts, it is safer to download
# the fonts. The pdf files will get bigger, though.
# Valid settings are true (download the fonts) or false (don't download
# the fonts).

# Map files.
################################################################
#
# There are two possible entries: Map and MixedMap. Both have one additional
# argument: the filename of the map file. MixedMap ("mixed" means that
# the font is available as bitmap and as outline) lines will not be used
# in the default map of dvips if dvipsPreferOutline is false. Inactive
# Map files should be marked by "#! " (without the quotes), not just #.

# This file will *not* be included in updmap.cfg if the lmodern package is

# This file is part of the set of files used to (indirectly) generate the
# final map files such as psfonts_{t1,pk}.map, {pdftex,dvipdfm}_{,n}dl14.map,
# ps2pk.map, builtin35.map and download35.map under /var/lib/texmf/fonts/map/
# (with psfonts.map being a symbolic link to one of psfonts_{t1,pk}.map,
# pdftex.map a symbolic link to one of pdftex_{,n}dl14.map and dvipdfm.map a
# symbolic link to one of dvipdfm_{,n}dl14.map, the choice depending on your
# updmap configuration, which you can customize by altering the files in
# /etc/texmf/updmap.d/ and running update-updmap).
#
# You should *not* modify the aforementioned final map files under
# /var/lib/texmf/fonts/map/ directly, for they are automatically generated by
# updmap-sys(1). Instead, you should read update-updmap(1), updmap-sys(1) and
# if you actually need to make changes to the aforementioned final map files,
# you should make the changes in /etc/texmf/updmap.d/, use update-updmap to
# regenerate /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg and finally updmap-sys to
# regenerate the final map files.
#
# Reading /etc/texmf/updmap.d/00updmap.cfg can also help understand how all
# this works.
#
#
# Declare the basic Latin Modern map files for use by the updmap-sys(1)
# machinery.
