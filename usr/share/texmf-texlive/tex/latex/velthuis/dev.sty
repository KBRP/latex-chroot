% Change of the comment.
%
% Revision 1.3  2006/03/31 09:53:50  icebearsoft
% As suggested by TeX Live developers, dev.sty was renamed to devanagari.sty
% and dev.sty just loads devanagari.sty for compatibility with old documents.
%
% Manual is updated accordingly. Moreover, new features of the preprocessor
% are mentioned and an example of using custom LaTeX command si given.
